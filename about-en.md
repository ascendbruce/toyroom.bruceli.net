## My Interests

I have quite a few interests and they change often. Feel free to chat if you share similar interests!

* **Listening to music:** My music taste is quite broad, from classical to death metal. I listen to many genres, mainly English and Japanese, but also some Korean and Spanish
* **Headphones & Speakers:** Since I listen to music frequently, I do care a bit about playback equipment → [My Audiophile Chronicle]({% link _pages/audiophile-tw.md %})
* **Following artists:** My favorite singer is LiSA (Japan), [Why I'm a fan of LiSA]({% link _posts/2018-07-09-the-reason-i-am-a-big-fan-of-lisa.md %}). I even own [Just Ear XJE-MH/L1SA (LiSA collaboration) custom in-ear monitors](https://medium.com/p/8af29b49c6f6). I also quite like Ado, [Why I'm a fan of Ado]({% link _posts/2025-05-25-the-reason-i-am-a-big-fan-of-ado.md %})
