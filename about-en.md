Hi!

I am Bruce Li, a.k.a. Li PoChun (黎柏均), a web developer in Taipei, Taiwan.

I will post some articles about learning ruby, rails, other techniques such as javascipts, git and linux/mac configuration. Some of them will be in English.

I am not a native English speaker. So feel free to correct me on spelling, grammar etc. Other questions are also welcome.

My email address is:
